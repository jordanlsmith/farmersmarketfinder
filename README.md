# farmersmarketfinder

Have you ever wanted to find a farmers market in your area?  Do you know what season it is open? What are its hours? What types of produce or crafts can you buy there?

This Shiny app allows users to search for farmers markets by zip code, further filtering results by market season and products.

Data for this project are from the USDA National Farmers Market directory: https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets
